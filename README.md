Summary of Findings
Age Distribution (Histogram)
Most passengers were between 20 and 40 years old.

A smaller number of infants and elderly were aboard.

The age distribution is right-skewed, indicating fewer older passengers.

Age vs Survival (Boxplot)
Survivors tended to be slightly younger on average than non-survivors.

The interquartile range (middle 50%) for survivors was more centered around 20â€“40 years, while non-survivors had a wider age range.

There are some outliers in both groups, especially among older passengers.

Fare vs Age (Scatterplot with Hue = Survived)
Passengers who paid higher fares had a higher survival rate, suggesting a possible correlation with Pclass (ticket class).

Many passengers who paid low fares did not survive.

Children and infants in both low and high fare ranges also had varied survival outcomes, indicating other factors at play (like family members or class).
